## Ingredients

1 kg / 2 lbs apples (about 4 large apples, peeled and diced)

4 cinnamon sticks

2 lemons

1/2 cup + 2 tbsp castor sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar 

1 cup a.p. flour 

pinch of salt

4 oz / 1 stick unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)

2 cups cornflakes

vanilla ice cream to serve

## Directions

**Make stewed apples:** stew the diced apples, cinnamon sticks, 2 tbsp sugar (as per taste) and lemon juice over medium heat until soft. 

**Make the crumble:** mix the softened butter, remaining castor sugar, brown sugar, flour, and salt until crumbly -- not doughy. Add more flour as needed.

In a baking dish (I used a square 8x8 inch one), layer the stewed apples (remove the cinnamon sticks), then the crumble, and top with the cornflakes.

Bake for 20-25 mins in a 450Â°F preheated oven until the cornflakes are golden brown.

Serve hot with vanilla ice cream.
