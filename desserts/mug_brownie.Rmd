## Ingredients

3 tbsp brown sugar

3 tbsp a.p. flour

1 + 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder

pinch of salt

3 tbsp milk

1 + 1/2 tbsp cooking oil

dash of vanilla essence

1/4 cup chocolate chips

## Directions

In a microwave safe mug, add in all the dry ingredients and mix.

Add the wet ingredients and combine.

Stir in the chocolate chips, sprinkling 1 tsp of them on top.

Microwave for 45-60 seconds. I like it to be gooey so I prefer 45 seconds.

Serve with vanilla ice cream if available!
